<h2>Laryngealo cancer</h2>
<br><br><img src="laryngis.jpg"width="40%">
<li><Strong>Laryngealo cancer</strong> are mostly squamous cell carcinomas, reflecting their origin from the skin of the larynx.
<p>Cancer can develop in any part of the larynx, but the cure rate is affected by the location of the tumour. For the purposes of staging, the larynx is divided into three anatomical regions: the glottis (true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures); the supraglottis (epiglottis, arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, and false cords); and the subglottis.</p>
<p>Most laryngeal cancers originate in the glottis. Supraglottic cancers are less common, and subglottic tumours are least frequent.</p>
<p>Laryngeal cancer may spread by direct extension to adjacent structures, by metastasis to regional cervical lymph nodes, or more distantly, through the blood stream. Distant metastases to the lung are most common. In 2013 it resulted in 88,000 deaths up from 76,000 deaths in 1990. Five year survival rates in the United States are 60%.</p>
<br><br><h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
<p>The symptoms of laryngeal cancer depend on the size and location of the tumour. Symptoms may include the following:[3][4]
Hoarseness or other voice changes
<ol>
  <li>A lump in the neck</li>
  <li>A sore throat or feeling that something is stuck in the throat</li>
  <li>Persistent cough</li>
  <li>Stridor - a high-pitched wheezing sound indicative of a narrowed or obstructed airway</li>
  <li>Bad breath</li>
  <li>Earache ("referred")</li>
  <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
</ol>
Treatment effects can include post-operative changes in appearance, difficulty eating, or loss of voice that may require learning alternate methods of speaking.
<br><br><h2>Risk Factors</h2>
<p>The most important risk factor for laryngeal cancer is smoking. Death from laryngeal cancer is 20 times more likely for heaviest smokers than for nonsmokers.Heavy chronic consumption of alcohol, particularly alcoholic spirits, is also significant. When combined, these two factors appear to have a synergistic effect. Some other quoted risk factors are likely, in part, to be related to prolonged alcohol and tobacco consumption. These include low socioeconomic status, male sex, and age greater than 55 years.</p>
<p>Further risks stem from workplace exposure to polluted breathing air such as wood dust, paint fumes, and certain chemicals used in the metalworking, petroleum, plastics, and textile industries.and infections by Papillomaviridae.</p>
<p>People with a history of head and neck cancer are known to be at higher risk (about 25%) of developing a second cancer of the head, neck, or lung. This is mainly because in a significant proportion of these patients, the aerodigestive tract and lung epithelium have been exposed chronically to the carcinogenic effects of alcohol and tobacco. In this situation, a field change effect may occur, where the epithelial tissues start to become diffusely dysplastic with a reduced threshold for malignant change. <Strong><U>This risk may be reduced by quitting alcohol and tobacco.</strong></u></p>
